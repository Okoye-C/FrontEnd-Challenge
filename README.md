# FrontEnd-Challenge
For all FrontEnd Designs
Hey Guys!!!!

So my code here is relatively simple, Shouldn't be too hard to understand.
This readMe is to explain what it is I'm doing.

So I am challenging myself to do better, by taking up challenges from FrontEnd Mentor, and this is one of them.
This is a simple qr code challenge that took me a day to complete for some off reasons but anyway feel free to do or ask whatever you want
WITHOUT CHANGING MY CODE.

Love You, Thank You
